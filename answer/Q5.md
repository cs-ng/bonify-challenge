# Q5
I'm using Akka Stream to stream all the data in the provided `testdata.csv` into Postgres.

The `testdata.csv` consists of 10k random data that I've generated with Mockaroo, together with the 4 bank 
records provided in the question.

How to run
---
1. There are three ENV variable in this app, feel free to override accordingly
    - JDBC_URL (default to `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bonify`)
    - DB_USERNAME (default to `postgres`)
    - DB_PASSWORD (default to `postgres`)
    
2. Start the app `JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bonify DB_USERNAME=postgres DB_PASSWORD=postgres sbt run`

3. Then, you gonna need to hit the `POST http://localhost:9000/load`, this will trigger the data loading into the db. The process is 
observable in the console as there's a `println` on every inserting query. This should not take more than a few seconds.

4. Do a `GET http://localhost:9000/bank/:bankIdentifier` to get the bank record, the name of the bank will be 
printed to console.

Tests
---
There is a limitation on running the test as I did not implement an embedded db for testing purpose.
The tests can only be run **when there are records in the table**, 

Step #3 is required prior to running the test.
